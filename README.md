### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Andres Reyes here! As a passionate Computer Scientist, I leverage programming to bring ideas to life. This GitHub space features projects I've genuinely enjoyed creating, and I'm actively seeking new challenges to contribute to the broader Computer Science landscape.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Wedding Invitation Website
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js (Express.js) and Vue.js (frontend)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any programming project that will satisfy my passion for problem-solving through code.
