### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andres Reyes, and in my github you will find some of my favorite projects that i have worked on in my time at George Mason University as a
Computer Science major. Currently i'm learning React to build some experience in webdev. I plan to have some collaboration projects with a fellow friend from 
George Mason who is also a Computer Science student. Aside from all the fun projects done as a CS major, I plan to do work on personal projects to keep gaining
experience on new things.

NOTE: I have several private projects that I cannot make public due to GMU policy, please contact me if intrested in seeing them.
